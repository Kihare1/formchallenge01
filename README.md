# Explorer Challenge 06 - Forms 01
- First challenge project involving forms in html/css
- First time using the <form> / <input> commands to make a form, I'll show how it looks with the zoom out to see the whole page and 2 screenshots of the page with a default browser zoom!
- The challenge followed the same idea, I had a Figma project that needed to become html/css code

- Zoom out page
